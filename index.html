<h1>No Trademark <sup>TM</sup></h1>
<hr>
<p><strong>Trademark <sup>TM</sup></strong> is a collection of creative professionals with the goal of pushing each of our abilities, 
getting to know other creative professionals, and not giving a shit about boundaries. So much so, that Adam Brown wouldn't 
let me use my CSS security blanket on this page. I am screaming inside.</p>
<p>We're in planning phase right now, so if you want use to keep going, please kick our ass until this becomes a 'thing'.</p>
